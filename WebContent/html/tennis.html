		Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles) or between two teams of
		two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball
		covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in
		such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not
		gain a point, while the opposite player will.
		<br/><br/>
		Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone
		who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England,
		in the late 19th century as "lawn tennis". It had close connections both to various field ("lawn") games such as
		croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th-century in fact, the term
		"tennis" referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere
		announces that he will "go down to Hampton Court and play tennis."
		<br/><br/>
		The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to
		keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to
		professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system,
		which allows a player to contest the line call of a point.

			<li>The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches (73.66 cm) in length and 12.5 inches
			(31.75 cm) in width.</li>
			<li>The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any

			<li>The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.</li>
			<li>The rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For
			example, the maximum length of the frame had been 32 inches (81.28 cm) until 1997, when it was shortened to
			29 inches (73.66 cm).</li>

		Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread 
		and stuffed with feathers.[38] Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized 
		rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually
		changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved
		visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, 
		deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play.
